used for intracellular studies. we wish to apply this method to industrially needed proteins as well and call attention to its usefulness there. as an example we would like to render the use of high quantities of the chemical enzyme inhibitor boric acid unnecessary, which is classified as a substance of very high concern by the european chemicals agency. at the moment, boric acid is used for protease inhibition in washing detergents and dilution in the washing machine activates it again. thus, tons of it are being processed every year. photocaging could help circumvent this. a photocaged amino acid will be incorporated at a crucial position in the enzyme by genetic codon reassignment. prior to the washing procedure the enzyme can be easily activated by exposure to a light source.'),(3439,'mc yeast: stress-based detection and enzymatic degradation of the cyanobacterial toxin microcystin','cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, are an annual problem in many water systems. during the summer, the bacteria release hepatotoxins called microcystins (mcs) which pose health risks to humans and animals. the goal of our project is to build a two-part system to detect and then degrade mcs. our detection system is based on the natural oxidative stress response of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. exposure to mcs is linked to higher levels of oxidative stress, and we will couple this response to the expression of yellow fluorescent protein. thus, fluorescence levels will indicate the amount of mcs present in a sample. to understand and validate our mc detection mechanism, we will also create mathematical and molecular models. for degrading the detected toxins, we will express and purify the enzyme microcystinase (mlra), which is naturally found in some gram-negative bacteria. the enzyme renders the mcs harmless by modifying their structure.'),(3440,'bio-compass 2.0','a new updated version of bio–navigational system that enables a faster acquisition of optimal pathway will be built by the bio-compass 2.0 to break the limitations of computational capacity in the big data era. dna will be used to encode the information of points and pathways on the map, and log into the bio-navigation database. in this way, each feasible solution can be obtained by the corresponding biochemical operation. because of the high parallelism of the dna calculation, the solution is rapid. then by selecting the feasible solutions, finally determine the optimal solution. compared with ahut_china 2014\'s project, bio-compass 2.0 has added identification site, path length, and adjacent site number information into the dna sequence used for path expressing. besides, quaternary has been applied in our calculation to optimize the data extraction methods. these improvements have boosted our system’s practicability and suitability when it is applied into more complex navigation.'),(3441,'circrna deregulation and hcc','liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the world. egypt has a one of the highest incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) in the world. treatment options for hcc are limited and often inefficient. circular rnas(circrna) belongs to the family of noncoding rnas. they play a role in gene expression regulation and act as mirna sponge. recently, it was found that their levels are deregulated in various types of cancer. using bioinformatics analysis, we have identified certain circular rnas that are down regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma. so, we are aiming to design a system that can sense circrna deregulation in the hcc and respond in a way to restore the balance and equilibrium in the circrna environment of the cancer cells. also, we are evaluating the therapeutic effect of circrna as a potential novel target for the treatment of hcc.'),(3442,'highway to platinum','platinum is one of the rarest and most valuable metals in the world. thanks to its physical and chemical properties, it has become pervasive in modern society. one of the main uses of platinum is in cars\' catalytic converters, hence important concentrations have been accumulated over time in soils next to roads. our goal is to recover this platinum as much as possible and obtain nanoparticles, in two steps. the first stage relies on the affinity of desferrioxamine b, a siderophore, to bind platinum and so favor the further solubilisation of more platinum compounds. secondly, a modified flic protein complex will be cloned into e. coli and enable the biosorption of platinum on the flagella of the bacterium.'),(3443,'strategies for blocking propagation of supercoiling generated during transcription','construction of complex circuits is still hampered by ignorance of fundamental principles of genetic circuit design. one key challenge is the isolation of independent genetic components -- genes expressed on the same plasmid (or other dna molecule) will often unexpectedly interfere with or enhance each others\' expression in an orientation-dependent fashion, even if they are nominally isolated by terminators and other motifs. this form of cross-talk may be caused by supercoiling generated during transcription, which has been shown to enhance or repress gene expression depending on the form of supercoiling. to test this hypothesis, we will test whether base pair spacing, terminators, or dna \"clamps\" (made from dna-binding proteins) placed between genes on a plasmid can eliminate their cross-talk. if dna clamps do isolate nearby transcriptional units, then those clamps may advance the field of synthetic biology by allowing bioengineers to build more predictable genetic circuitry.'),(3444,'ringtones: diverse homoserine lactone systems for cellular communication','many bacteria use quorum sensing (qs) to regulate group behaviors, such as bioluminescence and virulence, by sending and receiving small molecules called homoserine lactones (hsls). bioengineers have incorporated qs networks into genetic circuits, using hsls to connect logical operations. however, higher-order genetic circuitry is inhibited by “crosstalk,” in which one qs network responds to hsls produced by another network. in addition to making it challenging to engineer with multiple qs networks, crosstalk has the dangerous potential to activate virulence pathways in pathogenic bacteria. using a system that decouples “senders” from “receivers,” we are exploring how qs networks from different species behave and which networks have crosstalk. our project adds 21 new plasmids for qs-based communication, including 12 novel qs proteins, to the igem registry, helps to deepen the knowledge of bacterial communication, explores biosafety implications of engineering with hsls, and empowers bioengineers to build more complex genetic circuits.'),(3445,'fast pace petase','in recent years, the production of polyethylene terephthalate (pet) has increased rapidly, as a result of low production costs and consumer demands. pet is one of the most common plastic polymers, comprised of repeating monomeric subunits of terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol. it is frequently used in the manufacture of plastic bottles and clothing fibres, especially in japan. as avid users of pet-based products, our team decided to research how to optimise the degradation of pet, which takes an average of 450 years to degrade naturally. we were further inspired to pursue this goal with keio university’s recent discovery of ideonella sakaiensis — a unique bacteria capable of pet degradation. thus, we have focused our project on the synthesis of an optimal petase biobrick, which would be included in the igem database. ultimately, our goal is to find an ideal promoter to expedite the production and secretion of petase.'),(3446,'null','null'),(3447,'null','null'),(3448,'the bucha bunch','kombucha is a fermented tea drink composed of a community of several types of bacteria and yeast. this study’s aim is to understand and manipulate this community to imbue kombucha with favorable properties for producers and consumers. one common problem producers face is ethanol overproduction by lachancea fermentati, making the kombucha alcoholic. this study screens l. fermentati using ypd agar plates with bromothymol blue, which changes color with changes in acidity. the color change allows for low-ethanol producing colonies to be selected for and recapitulated into the microbial community. another issue for some would-be consumers is the taste of kombucha. by codon-optimizing an arabadopsis gene for bacteria, gluconobacter and gluconoacetobacter can be transformed to produce brazzein, a sweet-tasting protein, thus sweetening the kombucha. furthermore, these chassis organisms will be transformed with a gfp gene and ph-activated promoter to create a time-lapse of the changes that kombucha’s microbial community undergoes.'),(3449,'null','null'),(3450,'programmable and open-source test paper based on cell-free system','we endeavor to create a test paper which is programmable, open-source and cell-free. the test papers contain genetic circuits which could measure the concentration of various target molecules in clinical and laboratory samples with visual and semi-quantitative results shown by reporter proteins. with a genetic device which acts as a signal amplifier, the system resembles the binary system of computer with enhanced sensitivity. the bionic and open-source nature of the test paper results in a high range of detection as well as high programability, while the cell-free nature removes interference between biological reactions inside the cells and allows its preservation under frozen condition for almost a year. the system can also be reprogrammed with the aid of our protocol, another proof of its potential.'),(3451,'plasticure: offering an effective and energetically favorable biodegradation solution for pet','the plastic waste problem has taken its toll on the environment and affects diverse eco systems. many solutions are available, but their side effects are damaging the environment due to plastics toxicity. as plastic was only recently introduced to nature, native biodegradation solutions are not sufficient to overcome the massive amounts of plastic debris in oceans and land. our goal is to improve biodegradation solutions using synthetic biology tools, from force evolution of a polyethylene degrading bacterium, through protein engineering of pet degrading enzyme, to genetically engineering a metabolic pathway that will enable our selected bacteria to consume pet as a sole carbon source. moreover, utilizing the high energy stored in pet, electrons released from pet oxidation will be immediately harnessed at an anode of a biofuel cell for electricity production. thus, our project will provide a clean, productive and energy efficient process for plastic biodegradation.'),(3452,'null','null'),(3453,'evobodies - molecular speed dating','we are developing a novel system for generating binding proteins in e. coli via directed evolution. such proteins could be utilized for target-mediated drug delivery and in diagnostics, especially for the detection of quickly evolving pathogens such as viruses. moreover, many applications for basic research are also feasible. as the starting point of our system, we design a library of sequences encoding binding proteins in e. coli. afterwards, we use a special dna-polymerase, for increasing diversity through error-prone replication of the desired sequence. finally, binding proteins with high affinity to the target protein are selected. this selection is mediated by protein-protein interaction, granting a selective advantage to cells in which tight binding proteins are expressed by an increase in fitness under selective pressure. therefore, the desired clones are enriched in the fermentation broth and can be identified easily.'),(3454,'smelling cancer - a voc-based biosensor for cancer diagnosis','cancer is a complex disease related with uncontrolled proliferation of body cells. having different types, each type of cancer has its own characteristics on molecular level. different molecules are produced by cancer cells such as proteins, and secondary metabolites. because of their specificity, they have been used as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis over past decades. recently, volatile organic compounds have been identified as biomarker to discriminate the types of cancer. in this project, we plan to construct bacterial whole-cell biosensors for detecting volatile organic compounds (vocs) to diagnose cancer. different vocs will be sensed by different promoter/transcription factor couples, and they will be incorporated into circuits and logic gates operated by crispri system in order to differentiate cancer types effectively based on existence of specific vocs.'),(3455,'null','null'),(3456,'bioproduction of taurine: metabolic pathway insertion in escherichia coli','taurine is a pseudo-aminoacid derivative of cysteine which can be obtained naturally by some foods, biosynthesized by some organisms or produced through a series of chemical reactions. taurine synthesis is an important process as it plays many roles in the functions on the human body, among other organisms. the main aim of our project is to successfully introduce a couple of enzymes into e. coli’s genome so it can biosynthesize this important molecule. to achieve this, these two taurine-pathway enzymes were selected: cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase (csad) and cysteine dioxygenase (cod). it is important to highlight the fact that it’s the first time we synthesize both of them using synthetic biology techniques.'),(3457,'alarm of breast cancer based on detection of microrna-21 and microrna-155','in recent years, breast cancer has become one of the highest incidental cancer. if we can get early diagnosis and effective treatment measures,it will largely reduce the mortality of breast cancer. studies have shown that when have breast cancer, the expression degree of microrna-21 and microrna-155 in the serum will be significantly higher than the normal one. based on it,this project applies the artificial designed biological system to realize the detection of expression levels of microrna in the serum environment and produce green fluorescent protein,then detect fluorescence by miniaturized signal hardware,through the mathematical modeling of the model to calculate microrna expression level. finally the data presented to the user directly by the hardware device or to their phones. this project is a real-time inspection system for breast cancer detection,convenient and quickly.it can provide patients with reference significance testing data, reduce the testing costs drastically,alleviate the contradiction of medical treatment system.'),(3458,'plasmid-sensing logically and adjustably cell killer (p-slackiller)','genetic engineering bacteria have revolutionized human society and one of the most commonly used vectors are plasmids. however, the plasmid as a powerful tool has some natural limits like the segregational instability which may cause the change of population structure. this year our project aims to prove a new concept of plasmid quorum sensing which can be applied to control the plasmid numbers quantitatively and preventing the losing of recombinant plasmids in the same time. compared with the traditional methods like using antibiotics or auxotrophic bacteria, our project can be more intelligent and controllable. in response to the inhibitor protein which is used as the signal indicating the plasmid numbers, the killer system will be turned on or off. according to our design, e.coli containing less plasmids than the threshold that has been set theoretically will be defined as slackers, and they be killed to optimize the population structure.'),(3459,'absorption of calcium in water by expression calcium channel protein in escherichia coli','bnds_china is going to enable escherichia coli (e. coli) bacteria to absorb calcium cations (ca++) from hard water. by the definition of hard water, the exceeded concentration of calcium ions causes extra soap consumption and galvanic corrosion. though there are already methods of softening hard water, they are either too expensive or inefficient. therefore, our team came up with this idea of making e. coli attracts calcium cations from hard water that serves as an affordable and functional form of hard water softener. e. coli with highly expressed calcium channel proteins absorb those calcium ions from the water into cytoplasm to decrease the concentration of calcium in water.'),(3460,'taxolight','it\'s widely known that taxol has noticeable effect to promote the inhibition of tubulin depolymerization and therefore stabilizing microtubules. based on this, our team designed a new way to test the existence of taxol, which may have higher resolution than current chemical approaches. firefly luciferase complementation(flc) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation(bifc) assay is the core part of our experiments. we expressed one specific tubulin connected with n-luciferase and c-luciferase respectively. when a-tubulin and b-tubulin tend to form dimers, the normal microtubules are being assembled and are likely to be depolymerized. however, the extremely stable microtubules would be established if taxol exists in the system. by detecting the fluorescent signal, we are able to tell the existence of taxol.'),(3461,'sleep with epic elegans','sleep disorders such as insomnia and narcolepsy affect many people in their daily life. today, there is no effective medication against these disorders. actually, they only treat the symptoms, not the source. this year, igem bordeaux 2016 aims to study dsip, a sleep-inducing peptide which seems to be promising for helping to sleep. in order to understand in which mechanisms this peptide is involved, it will be produced by the bacteria e. coli and then given to the nematode c. elegans. the sleeping process of this nematode will be studied by using both a photo-inductible system and a crispr-methylase system called epicrispr, which is a modified crispr/cas9 with the purpose of methylating genes participating in this process. the third project consist on study of the issue of plasmid propagation in bacterial populations by developping a computational model.'),(3462,'gemini: combining digital and analog expression systems','while natural systems integrate diverse “digital” signals to precisely specify “analog” gene expression levels, synthetic systems thus far have focused on controlling expression in either a digital or an analog capacity. our team sought to develop a “digitized-analog” expression system using crispr-dcas9, capable of specifying varied exogenous gene expression levels based on different signals. we first developed digital elements by pairing grnas with minimal operator promoters and using dcas9 to transactivate. we then created analog elements by multimerizing operator sites to obtain graded activation levels. finally, we integrated our digital and analog elements into higher-order genetic logic circuits to achieve varying expression responses. we characterized and optimized our system in human cells, enabling synthetic biologists to better control transgene expression for important therapeutic applications.'),(3463,'neptune: an integrated specify, design, and build hardware environment for synthetic biology microfluidics','microfluidic devices can greatly facilitate many biological experiments. however, they are not widely used due to high manufacturing costs and expertise required to use them. our project improves accessibility to microfluidic hardware development within the synbio community through an intuitive platform to design and build simple continuous-flow systems. neptune’s user interface allows researchers to easily specify high-level designs. it then validates, optimizes, and produces customized parametric blueprints of the setup. it guides users through manufacturing microfluidic chips and hardware at a cost orders of magnitude less than conventional methods. users can then control and automate experiments through neptune’s framework. neptune is available as an open source project to the entire igem community as well via the nona research foundation, laying the groundwork for capturing the advantages of microfluidics in essential experiments and applications in the synbio community.'),(3464,'crescentium','petroleum-derived chemicals are used as building blocks for a variety of products used in daily life, and while critical, their overuse has had significant negative environmental and societal impacts on the world. finding alternatives to petro-chemicals is highly desired as we transition to renewable sources. lignocellulosic biomass represents a sustainable feedstock for energy, chemical, and material production. however, efficient deconstruction and valorization of biomass remains a hindrance to its utilization in next generation biorefineries. to harvest the fermentable sugars and aromatics in plant biomass, a consolidated bioprocessing approach is currently needed to provide a cost effective and efficient scheme for funneling lignocellulose into high-value biochemicals. here, we have constructed a microbial community of e.coli and caulobacter crescentus, both synergizing in the degradation of biomass through the display of biomass transforming enzymes on the s-layer of c.crescentus; and the funneling of fermentable sugars and transformed aromatics into high-value biochemicals through

many important compounds, such as biofuels and vaccine antigens, with yields approximately 50x greater than the rest of the cell. however, little of this potential has been exploited, in the absence of a time-efficient chloroplast transformation protocol. using the alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii as our chassis, our transformation toolbox aims to shift the focus of plant engineering, by reducing the time needed for a homoplasmic chloroplast transformation from months to 1-2 weeks. we have created a library of chlamydomonas-optimised parts in the phytobrick standard, with a view to expressing cas9 in the chlamydomonas chloroplast for the first time. we hope to use it to propagate genetic modifications among all copies of the chloroplast genome, within a single generation. we will also develop a low-cost, open source chlamydomonas growth facility and gene gun to complement our protocol.'),(3468,'manipulating omp pores & acrab-tolc efflux pumps using crispr/dcas9 to enhance e. coli antibiotic susceptibility','antibiotics are a hallmark of modern medicine having saved numerous lives since the discovery of penicillin in 1928. bacteria resistant to antibiotics emerged shortly after their initial use, and is an increasing problem as pathogenic strains of bacteria evolve resistance to multiple drugs. in an effort to increase antibiotic susceptibility, we will use crispr/cas9 technologies to disrupt intrinsic resistance mechanisms in e. coli. specifically, we plan to enhance the expression of omp pores while also inhibiting the functioning of acrab-tolc efflux pumps. mechanism for effective delivery of a functioning crispr system in clinical settings will be explored.'),(3469,'split luciferase complementation assay for point of care diagnosis','we will assess the viability of a novel bioluminescence detection system for point-of-care diagnostic testing. in our proposed system, a streptococcus pyogenes dcas9 isoform codon optimised for escherichia coli is fused to the n-or c- terminal fragments of a thermostable ph-tolerant pyrophorus plagiopthalamus luciferase (luc). we aim to coexpress guidernas to target these chimeric dcas9-luc proteins to adjacent dna sequences. this will enable the reconstitution of luciferase activity and subsequent bioluminescence in the presence of luciferin. this light output constitutes a signal for detection of any targeted dna sequence, dependent on access to the target sequence. we plan to undertake a proof of concept study of this system using grnas targeted to the e.coli 16s rrna locus, to describe both the effective

nanostructures inside e. coli. our constructs open up new possibilities in future research on dna nanotechnologies as diagnostic tools, and promote the applications of mirna testing in clinical conditions.'),(3517,'tri-stable switch','our team aims at engineering a biological tri-stable switch which shows high orthogonality as bistable switch in escherichia coli. building on the brown 2006 and 2007 igem teams\' design, the tri-stable switch which consists of three alternating steady states that can be toggled by three different chemical inducers is improved. the construct was constructed with three promoters, lacp, phlfp and an ameliorated version of tetp together with their corresponding repressors. this combination enables the switch acting more stably by preventing it from reverting back to its natural states. mathematical analysis was performed to ensure a stable and robust behaviour of the switch. being orthogonal and more stable, the tri-stable switch could be applied in different fields, like biosensing and biocomputing. if the system is further studied and developed, it is foreseeable that it could contribute to the mature integration of different circuits in the future.'),(3518,'nematode biochemical marshal: attractant and repellent','inspired by the ability of horsehair worm modifying the behavior of other organisms, we would like to employ the idea to modify organisms behavior by what available in our laboratory. nematode is a pest, which will attack the roots of crops. we wish to modify its behavior by engineering bacteria to produce biochemical cues to attract or repel the worm. we identified two potential biochemicals, cinnamaldehyde and phenylpyruvic acid, which are possibly attractant or repellent to the nematode. we have designed a chemosensation assay to demonstrate the attraction and repulsion ability of the biochemical of interest. the results suggest that cinnamaldehyde is a strong repellent and phenylpyruvic acid is a moderate attractant to the worm. genetic engineering of bacteria to produce the two biochemicals are working in progress.'),(3519,'biosensor for toxin in chinese herb medicine','adulteration of heavy metal and toxin during manufacturing process has always been a concern to chinese medicine consumers. although there are a few methods (for example: icp-ms) to detect these harmful substances, the procedures often turn out to be expensive and inconvenient to most people. if the danger in herbs continues to cast shadows among people, it is only a matter of time that people stop eating chinese medicine and soon this important chinese culture might be gone forever. thus, we decide to create a series of cheap, user-friendly e. coli biosensor. when the bacteria detect certain poison in the medicine, they will produce fluorescence protein. that way, we can detect the poison inside the chinese medicine by just examining the fluorescence intensity. with this new design and aspect, we hope to see people regaining hope in this tradition, yet, this distinctive culture.'),(3520,'signal filter','stable gene expression within a threshold of novel system is very important to syn-biology creations. to achieve the goal, we tried to build a set of positive feedback fundamental tool kits in bi-stable or even multi-stable systems. the systems we have designed will not only be adaptable to some certain input or output signals, but also can change their threshold to meet different project purposes. most significantly, the positive feedback regulation system can transform an input pulse into stable output. so it can be applied in circuits as signal filter, which is very useful to many applications, such as treatment to lactose intolerance. we even further provided both prokaryotic version (engineered from ci/cro in bacteria phage y system) and eukaryotic version (adopted from abscisic acid related kinase system) to make it competent tool kits for synthetic biology engineers to compare and select for further application.'),(3521,'biopafiar: bio-pattern formation in augmented reality','bio-pattern formation is the establishment of spatial patterns in morphogenesis. when guided by computer, the spatial pattern of a group of cells can be altered in an augmented reality space created by superposing a computer simulated virtual space on a real culture apparatus. in our project, light-switchable synthetic gene circuits are adopted to control the mobility of e. coli cells by light-mediated real-time communication between the real bio-pattern in culture media and its virtual counterpart in computer simulation to implement a synchronized growth. eventually, the shape of the colony matches the preset pattern we want and thus a \"what you see is what you get\" platform for the study of bio-pattern formation is obtained. our system can also be extended to eukaryotic cell community to modulate cell fates in the future which will be particularly useful in aiding the development of biological tissues and the regeneration of organs.'),(3522,'cellfiefuge','bio-manufacturing commonly involves the culturing of genetically engineered microbes that produce product(s) of interest, which is followed by separation of the microbes from the growth media and finally, isolation and purification of the product(s). the infrastructure and running costs for the downstream processing are significant obstacles to the large scale adoption of bio-manufacturing, especially for small-scale start-ups that drive innovation. we have therefore developed a modular set of tools by designing biobrickstm for e. coli that firstly cause programmed induction of product synthesis upon reaching a certain tuneable population of cells, and secondly, autoaggregate the cells upon utilization of most of the nutrients available; these eliminate external induction and centrifugation, thereby minimizing costs. this is of special importance in india, where financial constraints often bottleneck entrepreneurial efforts in biotechnology, which is still a field in the early stages of its development.'),(3523,'improving measurement studies using dual-fluorescent reporter system','we have made an efficient measurement device to help igemers characterize their protein production modules, promoter and rbs parts, precisely. this device has enabled us to screen noisy dual protein production modules. in order to understand the modularity of rbs parts, we have validated an empirical model to predict protein expression levels using available expression data in literature. also, we have designed rna inducible boolean output switch (ribos) devices to turn on/off the translation of protein coding mrna, downstream of switch rna, via trigger rna molecules. modelling results have shown ribos to be highly orthogonal. as an application, we are making a non-invasive gene containment device with the help of ribos and crispr/cas9

in medical, engineering, clothing, biomedical and other such industries. spider silk cultivation being a very slow and cumbersome process, we came up with an idea aiming at synthesizing recombinant spider silk protein (masp2) and producing it extracellularly in our model bacteria e.coli. ensuring that the protein is secreted, we can change the nature of the production process from batch to continuous by reusing immobilised cells, and even use it for mass production. we aim at making two constructs for expressing silk outside the cell. we also aim at developing a novel detection system using fret dye pairs. this system will primarily be used in monitoring and modelling the cleavage activity of the hiv protease used for selective cleavage and controlled release of the silk protein. cfp and yfp will be used as fret dye pairs.'),(3526,'ecolibrium - developing a framework for engineering co-cultures','in nature, microorganisms live together and cooperate to accomplish complex tasks. as synthetic biology advances, we transition from unicellular systems to engineering at the multicellular level. a major obstacle, however, is ensuring stable coexistence of different cell types in co-culture. this year we are developing a genetically engineered artificial ratio (gear) system to control population ratios in microbial consortia. gear will employ a bi-directional communication system and novel rna control that can be implemented across different bacterial strains. we are also developing a software to facilitate the design and optimisation of co-cultures. in the future, we envision our gear system being used for distributed multicellular biocomputing and bioprocessing, as well as for microbiome engineering.'),(3527,'dna assisted assembly of modular nanowires','our project seeks to manufacture nanostructures. by bridging the two opposite approaches together we have devised a method to create a modular nanowires. with dna origami, self assembling properties organize the dna strand into patterns by using the local forces to find the lowest energy configuration, which is an bottom-up approach. to fold the dna strand into a well defined structure using dna staples is an example of top-down approach. dna has many advantages over traditional materials such as biological compatibility, low manufacturing cost and the information regarding shape and size is carried over upon replication. individual modules are 30-40 nm long 3d structures with hollow cavity that acts as scaffold for the gold nanowires. they self assemble into long nanowires and we attached photosystem ii protein from the synechocystis 6803 at one end of the wire to create a high efficiency machinery to harvest solar energy.'),(3528,'gotta detect \'em all: a multi-sti sensor based on aptamers','according to the world health organization, more than one million sexually transmitted infections (stis) are acquired every day worldwide. stis are a major concern regarding reproductive health beyond the immediate impact. initiating early patient care allows a better efficiency of the treatment. rapid detection and distinction of stis are therefore a crucial task. to provide a solution, we developed an all-in-one multi-detection device. we chose a recent and promising biotechnology enabling a robust detection of a wide variety of biomarkers. this approach is based on the high specific recognition of aptamers for a particular macromolecule. as a proof of concept, we focus first on the diagnosis of hiv and hepatitis b. by offering a simultaneous test for several diseases, our device has strong potential to improve early home diagnosis. from a body fluid sample, the patient will therefore be able to rapidly assess his health status at a low cost.'),(3529,'quantifly','nowadays, volatile organic compounds (vocs) are commonly found pollutants that have been proved present in a wide variety of everyday life situations. though they are dangerous and present almost everywhere, vocs are not efficiently detected. usual detection devices are very unprecise or requires a very long exposure time. we tried to address this problem by building a biosensor, perfectly adapted to on-field measurements that would allow us to easily and rapidly quantify the amount of vocs in the air. this biosensor relies on bioluminescence, a biochemical phenomenon that is commonly used in cell imaging. we are trying to develop a new application for bioluminescence that should allow us to create a biosensor of a new kind, entirely different from the existing devices. we are also working with aeronautical engineers in order to develop a drone able to safely contain our bacteria,that will later be used as a mobile detection platform.'),(3530,'detection of methamphetamine based drugs using a whole cell biosensor, e.cops','illegal usage of narcotics is one of the worst enemies of society. throughout the world, many people are suffering from the short and long term effects of these drugs, and the incidence of drug abuse is growing year by year. among these drugs, methamphetamine (meth) has an increasing role, as also stated in united nations office on drugs and crime (unodc) reports. as igemers from istanbul technical university, we believe that solving this world-wide problem is strongly related with the design and production of fast, precise and cheap detection technologies. with that in mind, we are in the process of constructing a fluorescent resonance energy transfer (fret) based whole-cell biosensor for the detection of meth-based drugs using anti-meth single-chain variable-fragment (scfv) and fluorescent proteins. we also conducted molecular dynamic simulations with different molecules to verify our

ability to preferentially settle in hypoxic regions, including solid tumors. we plan to construct a recombinant plasmid, which consists of dna replication origins and related genes from pmb-1 and puc18. in addition, we will clone hu, a bifidobacterium promoter, and tat-apoptin gene with a n-terminal secretion signal peptide into this plasmid. as a result, the plasmid can be amplified in both e. coli and bifidobacterium, and apoptin can be expressed in bifidobacterium. the bifidobacterium transformed with this plasmid can settle in the tumor regions, and secret the apoptin protein, which is specifically toxic to tumor cells. with the tat-mediated membrane crossing, apoptin should be able to enter into solid tumor cells and kill tumor cells.'),(3533,'micro rna, macro application','alzheimer is a disease prevailed in olds around the world and currently there hasn\'t had any effective treatment and the early diagnosis is hard to accomplish. current research has already found that the fold change of specific kinds of microrna has correlations with alzheimer\'s development. to improve the diagnosis method, we are developing a rapid and simple diagnosis for alzheimer\'s disease using the different expression of microrna between patients and healthy controls. a reporter carrier containing a repressed promoter is hoped to be constructed, which opening is controlled by microrna degrading or inhibiting mrna. the accuracy of the system will be increased by the synergistic effect of repressor proteins. combined with reporter gene, a couple of micrornas

ground and of the water-holding capacity of a soil. to prevent this problem, our team use bacteria cellulose (bc) that is produced by gluconacetobacter (komagataeibacter). this cellulose produced by microorganism is known as a raw materials of nata de coco and as having high water-holding capacity. we will utilize this high water-holding capacity for prevention of soil erosion. our object is to improve producing ability of guluconacetobacter by antisense method. we would like to prevent a soil erosion by increasing of water-holding capacity of soil with use of the improved

magnetic nanoparticles are grown from iron inside of organelle-like structures called magnetosomes. in this project, we will produce magnetite nanoparticles using a synthetic biology approach utilising enzymes involved in magnetosome formation. we will utilise proteins mamp, mamt and mamx, which were chosen due to their proposed involvement in promoting magnetite crystal maturation in m. gryphiswaldense. each of the genes will be incorporated both separately and as a set into e. coli with the aim of producing magnetite crystals in vivo in the cells. the proteins will also be purified and tested in vitro. our results will further our understanding of how bacteria cells are able to form and organise magnetite nanoparticles in magnetosomes, and demonstrate how synthetic biology

chemical concepts are still being used but there is still a significant amount of concentrated nitrogen source is being released into water basins all over the world. ammonia and urea can be toxic to local marine life and even during its metabolism by microorganisms they deprive water of oxygen which is life-threatening to marine species. we are working on creating a full metabolic pathway in one species to metabolize ammonia and urea into n2 gas which is 70% of our atmosphere. developing a synthetic pathway in most adaptable bacteria in waste water would allow us to use only one bacterium

\"meal-worm\". they can maintain their lives through consuming styrofoam due to the microorganism in their guts that degrade the styrofoam. a ps-degrading bacterial strain is called the exiguobacterium sp. strain yt2. however,the big problem of the meal-worms is that they are not able to dissolve pet. thus, we will insert the gene of this bacteria into e.coli by using the gene synthesis. then, we will test the pet disintegration ability of meal-worms after feeding them the modified e.coli. our hypothesis is that meal-worms will actively disintegrate pet after consuming the altered e.coli.'),(3539,'geletricell : agar utilizing dualcore emfc','efcs and mfcs have been studied for many years using variety of biological fuels. many obstacle of these fuel cells is that they often use food sources for humans. also they only produce a small amount of electricity. the goal of our project is to improve both of these problems. we used agar as the fuel, which is very abundant in the ocean but is not a primary food source for humans. we also combined traditional efc and mfc to create emfc which uses shewanella oneidensis mr-1 and diaphorase simultaneously to generate electricity. first, e.coli that displays agar degrading enzymes degrade agar to produce galactose and nadh. galactose is then used by e.coli to produce lactate and formate which shewanella oneidensis

overcome this global issue, igemkyoto aims to develop an intestinal bioelimination system that can physically remove nov from the body. in detail, we are creating recombinant e. coli expressing two types of surface-displayed proteins that each specifically bind to nov and cellulose. by orally administrating this e. coli and cellulose to the patient intestine, this e. coli will bind to nov, and would swiftly be taken out of the digestive system through its affinity to cellulose, as cellulose passes human intestine undigested. we have already produced the abovementioned e. coli, and confirmed its binding to norovirus virus-like particles from images of a scanning electron microscopy. we will show further examination of characteristics of this device, such as its binding capability.'),(3541,'switch','the concentration of proteins in a cell is determined by both the amount synthesized and the amount degraded. thus, protein degradation is a crucial aspect of maintaining intramolecular equilibrium. a class of atpases known as aaa+ proteins involves a well-known proteolysis mechanism known as clpxp in which clpx unfolds and translocates a tagged protein into a sequestered proteolytic compartment in clpp. we devised an inducible genetic construct in which clpxp will degrade a chromoprotein upon induction. the data will be gathered using a device that can quantify the color of the light reflected by the chromoprotein before and after induction. this will ultimately allow us to measure the relative strength of degradation and further characterize a well-known proteolysis mechanism. our characterization of clpxp will serve as a precursor for controlled protein delivery in medicines and subsequently a switch for biosensors.'),(3542,'reduce bioaccumulated heavy metals in fish by gut remediation','nowadays, heavy metals in the water have become a threat to fish and human consumers. current methods including physical-chemical remediation, phytoremediation and others are limited to deal with heavy metal pollution. we proposed a new approach named gut remediation to reduce bioaccumulated heavy metals in fish by gut microbiota. we designed a polypeptide which can bind to heavy metals including mercury and copper. then a novel gene metal catcher was designed based on the polypeptide with gfp and n-terminal region of inp. subsequent display of metal catcher on the e. coli surface showed highly sensitivity and selectivity of copper, mercury and cadmium, and permitted selective adsorption of copper, mercury. then, we fed cyprinoid fish with the transformant strains. result showed that experiment group have lower accumulation of heavy metals compared to the control. therefore, gut remediation is an ideal approach to control heavy metal contaminations in fish.'),(3543,'cheese (calcitonin hyper expression using e.coli in space exploration)','within the next decade, we are set to see the launch of a vast number of human missions to mars. however, a major issue associated with space travel is osteoporosis, a condition where there is a decrease in bone density. osteoporosis is treatable with calcitonin pills and nasal sprays but these treatments are ineffective. therefore we propose to use crispr/cas9 to create a model to stimulate upregulation of calcitonin secretion within e.coli as a new treatment. we will be constructing plasmids that contain the calcitonin promoter region and the crispr/cas9 system. these plasmids will be transformed into e.coli where we will test for the upregulation of calcitonin secretion using gfp and calcitonin assays. if the project is successful, it would provide a stepping-stone towards further gene-targeted therapies to treat health conditions that are acquired from

supplies is a widely spread hazard for the environment and our health on earth. however, it also poses a large challenge when colonizing our neighbour planet mars. martian soil contains 0.5 - 1% perchlorate, which therefore needs to be remediated in order to cultivate edible crops. the leiden igem team will equip the bacterium escherichia coli with the tools to convert the toxic perchlorate into chloride and oxygen by introducing a set of codon-optimized genes from dechloromonas aromatica, encoding for the perchlorate reductase complex and chlorite dismutase. besides this, we will study e. coli\'s gene expression under simulated martian gravity (0.38g) using a random positioning machine, to make sure that our system will function in a bioreactor on mars. altogether, our system is

antibiotic resistant pathogens in healthcare facilities has resulted in the ongoing reassessment of best practices to prevent their transmission. however, whether pathogen reservoirs exist in emergency medical services (ems) vehicles remains largely unknown. we characterized the microbiome of ems vehicles using nanopore next generation sequencing of isolated dna samples. based on the pathogens identified during sequencing, we developed a bacterial two hybrid selection system to generate custom single-domain antibodies (nanobodies?) that recognize important pathogens. selected antibodies were then used to create a rapid, low-cost and on site elisa-based testing kit. our project provides a framework for the detection of emergent pathogens and a practical solution for monitoring their presence within and outside of the healthcare system.'),(3546,'coagu.coli: using recombinant snake venom to treat traumatic hemorrhage','blood clotting is controlled by a highly regulated pathway that attempts to ensure a balance between clotted and unclotted blood within a wound. ?as a response to trauma, enzymes in the pathway activate sequentially to convert fibrinogen into fibrin.the fibrin strands cross-link together to form a polymer mesh that causes blood flow to slow and eventually cease at the wound site. ?however, without external intervention the natural clotting process is too slow to prevent excessive hemorrhage and death when bleeding is severe. proteins in some snake venoms have the ability to act as thrombin analogues and induce the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin at an accelerated rate, bypassing the regulatory pathway. the increased concentration of fibrin causes clots to form quickly within the bloodstream. our goal is to utilize recombinant protein from cerastes cerastes venom to prevent fatal hemorrhage and minimize thrombosis in cases of traumatic injury.'),(3547,'a crsipr case for biofuel','this year liu igem will be a part of the search for alternative energy sources, this as a result of global warming due to excessive use of fossil fuels. for this we will use crispr/cas9 in unicellular model algae chlamydomonas

in this project we want to create new biobricks consisting of inducible promoters to couple with a crispr/cas9-system in c. reinhardtii. the reason for the inducible promoters is to avoid complications such as toxicity of a constitutively active cas9. by causing cultures of algae to undergo genetic modification in response to high intensity light we believe we can solve this problem. with this method genes can be targeted in the model algae in order to regulate the lipid synthesis.'),(3548,'biotink - rethink tissue printing','in a society that struggles with organ shortage and the

bioink, we are able to instantly and site-specifically polymerize cells with defined surface biotin groups into a cross-connected mesh upon injection into a streptavidin solution. to deliver the

accruing an annual cost of approximately $2.5 billion. furthermore, experts predict that the burden of chronic wounds will increase rapidly in the near future. chronic wounds are unable to heal in an orderly set of stages or within a time period of about three months. the etiology of chronic wounds is very diverse, but patients frequently suffer from persisting chronic wounds due to their bodies overproducing wound site proteases. in turn, these proteases decrease wound healing rates by degrading host growth factors and the extracellular matrix of the wound site. our team is using a

chassis to engineer two different devices which would generate visible colour changes according to sweat ethanol concentrations. the first is a cell-free mechanism that uses alcohol oxidase, derived from pichia pastoris, to initiate redox chain reactions required for the colour conversion of indicator dyes. the second manipulates an ethanol-inducible gene-switch system, derived from aspergillus

commensal lactobacillus bacteria to bind and aggregate towards her2+ gi tumours. membrane-anchored binding proteins specific to her2 will be engineered into lactobacillus to redirect bateria for aggregation at the tumour site. with sufficient bacterial density, a quorum sensing mechanism triggers production of a vital t cell activating cytokine, interleukin-2 (il-2), to recruit tumour-specific t cells for an anti-cancer response. simulations of the bacteria in a possible tumour environment will help drive quorum-sensing design (e.g. promoter sensitivity). ethical concerns

legislation.'),(3555,'starscaffold - creating better multi-protein structures','our project, starscaffold, builds on the work of the 2014 melbourne igem team on star-like peptides, a special type of protein backbone with 4 arms. star-like peptides are an existing concept and have been demonstrated experimentally to have potential uses in augmenting enzyme reaction kinetics and improving performance of antimicrobial peptides. we aim to improve and optimise the design, primarily with the addition of split inteins. these are a special type of protein sequence which allow each arm of the peptide to be ligated to another protein of choice, which could be an enzyme or even other starscaffold units. we are focusing primarily on two main applications for the starscaffold; as a hydrogel

difficulty in anticipating which protocols will produce the best results. experimental practices may differ immensely across laboratories and precise details of these practices may be lost or forgotten as skilled faculty or students leave the lab to pursue other endeavors. furthermore, there are few well-defined protocols that are generally agreed upon by the scientific community, in part due to the lack of a system that can supply a measure of a protocol\'s acceptance. in order to address these problems, we set out to build a database that integrates a crowd-sourced ratings and

inheritance of specific genes and are currently being considered as a method to regulate mosquito populations. however, the ability of gene drives to spread quickly through entire populations raises serious ethical concerns, especially when the genetic change affects reproduction. to address this issue, we constructed both a gene drive and an inducible recovery drive and modeled the combined system using saccharomyces cerevisiae. our gene drive results in deletion of both copies of the ade2 gene from s. cerevisiae using the crispr/cas system, causing the yeast to turn red. as a safety mechanism, we constructed a tetracycline-inducible recovery drive to counteract the function of our gene drive. the recovery drive restores the ade2 gene allowing s. cerevisiae to return to its original color. our gene/recovery drive system advances foundational work towards controlling global pests and invasive species, protecting information stored in dna, and various other important applications.'),(3561,'defending north american bats against white nose syndrome','north american bats are suffering from an emerging fungal disease called white nose syndrome. affected hibernacula often face mortality rates in excess of 80%, an unsustainable loss in animals that only have one offspring per year. as it spreads, the disease impacts many bat species with roles in pest control and pollination. last year, we looked into modifying e. coli so that it would produce the volatile organic compound ocimene, which has been shown to slow fungal growth. this year we are continuing this work and are also investigating ways to sense wns to attempt to impact the cave environment as little as possible and target the fungus directly. we aim to analyze the use of leupeptin a and b found

endometriosis','affecting approximately 1 in 10 women, endometriosis is a disease caused by cells similar to the endometrium of the uterus growing elsewhere in the body. these growths, called endometrial lesions, cause severe chronic pain and infertility. because the only definitive diagnostic method is laparoscopic surgery, patients wait on average seven years between the onset of symptoms and an accurate diagnosis.the goal of the mit igem team\'s project is to expedite this diagnosis process with a genetic circuit that can sense the unique biomarkers of endometriosis. our circuit identifies whether cells are diseased by checking the cells\' mirna profiles and by sensing progesterone resistance, a hallmark of endometriosis. this identification process can be implemented in endometrial biopsy samples, eliminating the need for surgical diagnosis. our approach could lead to a less invasive diagnostic method, enabling earlier treatment and improving patient outcomes.'),(3563,'engineering cyanobacteria for improved tolerance to a freeze/thaw cycle','currently, the biotechnologically relevant model strain of cyanobacteria, synechococcus elongatus pcc 7942, lacks resilience to cold temperature perturbations. if large-scale operations for photosynthetic production of industrial compounds are to be realized, robustness to unpredictable weather conditions must be considered. two complementary approaches are being proposed to increase cold adaptation and resistance to freezing in s. elongatus. previously, it was shown the expression of lipid desaturase desa increases the cold-growth tolerance of s. elongatus. we now aim to improve this range by fine-tuning the expression of a riboswitch-controlled desa. we also hypothesize that introduction of sfr2 from arabidopsis thaliana-responsible for remodeling the outer chloroplast membrane for increased freezing tolerance-will increase cellular viability to freezing events. through this two-pronged approach, we aspire to engineer a cyanobacterial strain that ultimately could be used for the production of industrially-relevant products in unreliable environment conditions.'),(3564,'increased

constructed a recombinant strain of escherichia coli over expressing the indigenous [ni-fe] hydrogenase hyd1 and relevant maturases. energy of photons are transformed to excited electrons by semiconductors such as tio2, and methyl vionlogen transports the electron to the biocatalyst. noting that hydrogenases are commonly sensitive to oxygen, we constructed special silica encapsulation forming an anaerobic environment within bacteria cell clusters to avoid oxidative damage. the combination of biocatalyst, semiconductors and silica then leads to in air light-driven hydrogen

two-feature system, which can diagnose glucose level and auto-resetting. e. coli senses the urine for the glucose level, on the other hand, enterokinase degrades e. coli to configure the initial status for the next user. after detection, the collected data is converted into digital signals and sent to the app. this biosensor technique does not only empower diabetic patients to manage diabetes, but also alarm for non-diabetes to take care of their health simply. prevention is better than cure!'),(3570,'pantide- a new agricultural system that eliminates targeted pests','spider venoms are disulfide-rich insecticidal peptides that target a wide range of ion channels in the insect nervous system. the spider-venom peptides have toxicity against insect species including lepidoptera (moths and butterflies), diptera (flies and mosquitoes), and coleoptera (beetles). in our project, engineered escherichia coli expresses \'pantide family\' including -hexatoxin-hv1a, u2-segestritoxin-sf1a, and orally active insecticidal peptide (oaip). to improve the oral activity, we fuse spider-venom peptides with snowdrop (galanthus nivalis l.) lectin. the fusion peptides can be sprayed on crops and eliminate targeted pests by oral administration. the pantide family is eco-friendly, bio-degradable and safe to mammals compared with conventional pesticide. besides, a new

farmland and safeguard the ecological equilibrium remotely from the application in smartphones.'),(3571,'magnetosome: a new efficient and handy tool for protein purification','protein purification is commonly used in biochemical research, but can become a very tedious and inefficient procedure. we developed a system that can be used to conveniently and efficiently purify recombinant proteins with help of magnetosome. the system consists of two parts. first, we used escherichia coli to express an interest protein tagged by a spytag. second, we generated a spycatcher-fused mms13 protein and expressed it in the magetotactic bacteria amb-1 (magnetospirillum magneticum). these bacteria synthesize magnetosomes covered by phospholipid bilayer membrane, in which mms13 is tightly anchored. spycatcher binds spytag with high affinity, and thus spycatcher-mms13 anchored in magnetosomes can strongly bind spytag-conjugated protein and specifically bring it down with help of magnetic field. our system is applicable to efficiently purifying any interest protein for different research purposes.'),(3572,'its color: a light-inducible crispr/cas9-mediated gene expression activation system in

eukaryotic cells, to precisely manipulate target gene activation upon the light induction. we fused two light-activated plant proteins, cry2 or cib1, to a transcriptional activator vp64 or the  catalytic domain deleted tcas9, generating cry2-vp64 or cib1-tcas9 chimeric constructs. in the presence of a specific grna guide, the tcas9 domain from cib1-tcas9 binds to the promoter of a reporter gene. once exposing to blue light, the cry2 domain from cry2-vp64 can form a protein complex with cib1-tcas9, which in turn brings the vp64 domain to the chromatin and activates the reporter gene. we also plan to examine multiple light-sensitive elements, including lov(light-oxygen-voltage-sensing domain) and phy(phytochromoes), in order to provide various gene manipulation systems and to compare their efficiencies for gene activation.'),(3573,'culture shock: building biological analogues of electronic devices','the newcastle university igem 2016 team is creating a novel field of synthetic biology by fusing biological function with electronic predictability. our project, culture-shock involves augmenting electronic circuitry with biological components to create an electro-biological hybrid system. these biological alternatives include lightbulbs, batteries, capacitors and resistors: for the lightbulb, we are building a genetically-encoded device based on the htpg heat-shock promoter; for the battery, we are modifying the pore proteins of escherichia coli to improve a microbial fuel-cell; for the capacitor we are investigating timed interactions of two different repressors and for the resistor, we will exploit the ability of metallothionein proteins to sequester conductive metals. we will assemble these devices in a breadboard format, specifically designed

and malignant. however, a perfect treatment of cancer has not appeared so far. the goal of our project is to develop a strategy to treat cancers, with building a transplantable drug system targeting a specific molecule that functions in cancer. we packed sirna into exosomes (nano-sized vesicles secreted by human cells) to deliver our drug into certain part of a patient\'s body. then we modified our exosome with irgd to act as integrin-specific targeting tool. our validation experiments will be carried out at the level of cells and animals to prove both the targeting and silencing function of

waste of energy and information. wastewater treatment consumes an enormous amount of energy, yet the water contains a wealth of reduced molecules that go unharvested. wastewater is also a reservoir of information about the bacterial communities surrounding treatment centers, currently this information is only accessed through metagenomics. to address the waste of potential energy, we designed and investigated multiple plasmids to resolve issues that plague microbial electrolysis cells. we also designed a conjugative crispr/cas plasmid with a built in cfp reporter that can be used to monitor

experimenting with shewanella oneidensis mr-1, which possesses the mtrcab \'molecular nanowire\' complex. using this system, electrons can channel into the cell and to hydrogenase enzymes that reduce protons to diatomic hydrogen, storing electrical energy as chemical energy within h2. the natural process yields low amounts of h2 and is not currently economically scalable. biowire intends to increase h2 yields using a single vector that will express recombinant hydrogenase genes. western blotting and gas chromatography will quantify protein expression levels and h2 yields, respectively.

successful implementations of equivalent systems in living cells would open up new possibilities for regulation and manipulation of cell metabolism. this project will implement a biological xor gate by exploiting a naturally occurring type of dna called dna ribozymes. these single stranded dna sequences are able to bind to and cut sequence specific rna sequences, almost like restriction enzymes for rna. combining dna ribozymes with silencing of reporter gene expression will allow us to design a system which responds to inducer signals in an xor-gate like fashion inside living cells. the xor

metabolite levels in its microenvironment and then respond by delivering biomolecules into target cells. as a proof-of-concept, escherichia coli was engineered to detect increased level of lactate, then respond by attaching itself to a cancer cell marker, and subsequently release biomolecules into the cell. a kill switch will be activated when there is insufficient lactate present, thus minimising non-specific targeting. in addition, our delivery system also has the flexibility to detect other environmental metabolites, together with the ability to engineer the bacterium to bind to

synthetic promoter (based mainly on the ckm and itgax genes) designed to facilitate strong expression in muscle and myeloid cells, blocks of cpg dna motif designed to stimulate innate immunity through toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9), and a dsrna-coding pol iii-dependent gene designed to stimulate innate immunity through retinoic acid-inducible gene i (rig-i) receptor. this vector will allow for the development of a new generation of highly potent dna vaccines against hiv, hence the project designation hi,vax!'),(3602,'urinetrouble: detecting antibiotic resistance equipment','uioslo 2016 picks up the mantle in the battle towards antibiotic resistance, one of the biggest threats to the world as we know it. they aim to create a diagnostic test for resistant bacteria so fast, cheap and easy to use that it can be used anywhere, at any time. not only will they detect dangerous bacterial enzymes, but by reimagining crispr/cas9-technology, the team proposes a design of a gene detection tool that can detect also the resistance genes themselves. along with their test they present phonelab - an app of their own design to interface with their test. by improving diagnostics, unnecessary and wrong use of antibiotics may be prevented, enabling us to contain the spread of resistant microbes before it becomes too late for all of us.'),(3603,'just in time: a library of growth phase dependent promoters','most promoters in the igem registry can be separated into two categories. there are constitutive, or “always on,” promoters of various strengths. there are also inducible promoters, which activate transcription based on environmental factors such as light, ph, or the presence of certain molecules. uiuc_illinois is characterizing a promoter library that gives more control over gene expression, without the need for inducers. we are isolating a set of e. coli promoters that turn on and off according to the host’s growth phase. for example, one promoter may become active during exponential growth but shut off as growth slows. another promoter may exhibit little to no activity until stationary phase has been reached. these promoters will be useful tools for any teams wishing to time protein production in vivo, for applications such as metabolic engineering, probiotics, or more.'),(3604,'in vivo production of fatty acid methyl esters in cyanobacteria utilizing the insect methyltransferase, dmjhamt','biodiesel is mainly composed of fatty acid methyl esters (fames) and is a renewable energy source. currently fames are synthesized through transesterification of free fatty acids (ffas) using a methyl donor, such as methanol, along with an alkaline catalyst to speed up the reaction. both the extraction of ffas and the chemicals used in this process are expensive. we intend to reduce the production cost of biodiesel by producing fames in vivo using an insect methyltransferase called drosophila melanogaster juvenile hormone acid o-methyltransferase (dmjhamt) within synechococcus elongatus pcc 7942. dmjhamt transfers the methyl groups from endogenous s-adenosyl-l-methionine (sam) to ffas therefore synthesizing fames. to minimize extraction costs, we aim to induce self-lysis in synechococcus at maximum optical densities using quorum sensing. by regulating the production of autoinducers with promoters of various strengths, we plan to tune the optical density at which gene expression is activated.'),(3605,'biosequestration and subsequent degradation of methane to combat greenhouse gas emissions','global climate change is the most profound threat facing society. greenhouse gasses like carbon dioxide and methane are major contributors, with methane being 29 times more potent than carbon dioxide. sources of methane include landfills and animal farms. current methods to control methane emissions include combustion into carbon dioxide, which depletes methane but at the levels present naturally is inefficient for generating energy. we plan to create strains of e. coli that break down methane using methane monooxygenase from methanotrophs, organisms that use methane as an energy source. methane will be oxidized into methanol, which could be extracted for industrial use, but we plan instead to introduce other metabolic pathways (perhaps in co-cultured bacteria) that convert methanol into cellular metabolites (biomass) or else carbon dioxide. our biological removal of methane could be implemented into the piping of landfills as an environmentally friendly strategy for ameliorating global climate change.'),(3606,'temperature controlled gene expression via rna thermometers','much like proteins, solitary strands of rna develop secondary structures due to the bonding between nucleotides which comprise the rna strand. the secondary structures can inhibit ribosomal binding and translation initiation, preventing synthesis of amino acids and proteins. through the introduction of heat, the bonds between nucleotides can be separated creating a linear strand of rna which may be translated. this temperature-controlled gene expression may be used in any variety of applications given further foundational research in quantifying protein production whilst knowing the secondary structure and melting temperatures. to allow for such quantification, synthetic rna sequences of known secondary structure and corresponding melting temperatures will be ligated upstream of reporter fluorescent and chromaprotein genes. the varying levels of color or fluorescence expression based on the temperature of the studied cells will be used to create mathematical models for future use of rna thermometers.'),(3607,'transport of proteins in e. coli via omv biogenesis','our primary project goal is the production of a fusion protein system capable of importing select proteins into outer membrane vesicles and through those vesicles, other cells. in comparison to other cell-cell communication methods, such as liposomes, viral vectors and quorum sensing, our system will take one step to apply and prevent serious degradation of the protein via the natural double membrane structure of an omv. because e. coli is naturally used widely by biology labs and is easy to produce, our project has the potential to revolutionize molecule based transport therapeutics and greatly decrease the issues future igem teams may experience transporting and using their proteins.'),(3608,'nitrogen \"breaking\" bacteria','high nitrate levels caused by nitrogen-rich fertilizers lead to numerous health and environmental consequences. by designing a bacteria that can thrive in this contaminated water and reduce the nitrates to other molecules, we can minimize the impact caused by high nitrate levels. our approach is to engineer an e. coli that has these capabilities and will not be harmful to the environment. a portion of the nap operon found naturally in e. coli will be over-expressed to produce nitrate reductase that can reduce nitrate ions to nitrite ions. this design could be further built upon to eventually reduce nitrate ions completely to nitrogen gas. we also designed a kill switch that only allows the bacteria to grow in areas with high nitrate levels. a sera strain of e. coli is used as the chassis and is complemented with a plasmid containing the sera gene with the nitrate-sensitive pyear promoter.'),(3609,'rogue e.coli: a biphenyl detective','production of polychlorinated biphenyls (pcbs) was banned in 1979, but these toxic chemicals still remain in soil and water worldwide. bioaccumulation of these probable carcinogens disrupts activity of the nervous, immune and endocrine systems of animals. the current testing methods are unable to detect pcbs at the levels required by the us epa (environmental protection agency). the unh team proposed to develop a highly sensitive biosensor for biphenyl. previous igem teams attempted to design pcb biosensors, but their results were not conclusive. biphenyl is the chemical backbone of pcbs. genetic circuits were designed using the bph operons from pcb degrading bacteria using e.coli as the host. if biphenyl is present in a water source, it should be converted into an intermediate that can activate the bph circuit and the signal will be further amplified through a positive feedback loop, resulting in a fluorescent output even at low concentrations of biphenyl.'),(3610,'cosmocrops: a modular platform for sustainable bioproduction in space','space missions face the problems that transporting mass is expensive and the needs of long expeditions are unknown in advance. it would be revolutionary to have the capacity to manufacture various resources needed without prior knowledge of exact mission requirements. we have designed a modular co-culture system to accomplish this: containing the cyanobacterium synechococcus elongatus to use co2 and light, which are plentiful on mars, to produce sucrose. this is used as a common feedstock by bacillus subtilis to generate essential end-products. we used polylactic acid as a proof-of-concept, since 3d printers can use it for tools and machine parts. to examine the co-culture’s practicality in extraterrestrial environments, the cutting-edge jens martin mars chamber was used to test stresses including uv exposure and pressure extremes. we propose that bacillus’s sporulation ability will enable missions to maintain libraries of strains for constructing a versatile array of materials for future space exploration.'),(3611,'bleb','some bacteria naturally bleb: a process whereby their outer membrane pinches in and buds off. the result of this is an outer membrane vesicle (omv), a nanoscale lipid bubble, released into the environment. these omvs can be decorated on the outside with outer membrane proteins, and can encapsulate periplasmic proteins within. given this, omvs have the potential to be tailored to a variety of functions, by targeting proteins either to the periplasm or outer membrane. this customisable nature means that omvs could become a new platform technology for the application of future synthetic biology projects. currently, however, there is no standardised system for inducing hypervesiculation in bacteria, and thus our project compares the effect of different genetic factors on omv formation. with this data we will produce the ultimate strain of blebbing bacteria which can be utilised for the production of omvs adapted for environmental, medical, or industry purposes.'),(3612,'degradation of pet plastic using petase and mhetase from the bacterium ideonella sakaiensis','the bacterium ideonella sakaiensis was discovered in 2016 by japanese researchers from the kyoto institute of technology. it is able to degrade pet - a common consumer plastic - into terephthalic acid, which poses no threat to our environment. we aim to isolate the two enzymes within ideonella sakaiensis that undertake this reaction, petase and mhetase, and express them in escherichia coli. petase first breaks down pet into methyl-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate or mhet. mhetase then converts mhet into terephthalic acid. the two enzymes will be assayed for activity, after which we shall analyse them using cryo electron microscopy to produce a 3d structure with a point resolution of 0.27 nm. we then aim to secrete these enzymes into the periplasm of the bacterium using the ompa secretion system within e. coli. this will be achieved by fusing a leader sequence to the two enzymes from the ompa gene.'),(3613,'the subtilis defence','one of the greatest barriers to long term space travel is the exposure to high energy ionizing radiation (ir). exposure to ir can induce double stranded breaks which are very cytotoxic, resulting in cell death. current solutions, while effective in low earth orbit, are less so outside of the magnetosphere. the 2016 u of c calgary team address this problem through synthetic biology and the engineering of bacillus subtilis. a strain of b. subtilis has been engineered to express a recombinant peptide, bowman-birk protease inhibitor (bbi), which has radio-protective effects. the bacteria are contained within a patch, allowing for continuous secretion of the peptide into the body. while the initial system is designed to produce bbi, restriction sites within the gene constructs allow for any gene to be inserted, creating a versatile expression platform. this can be customized for the secretion of bio-therapeutics for future space missions.'),(3614,'polybiome project: colorectal cancer preventive treatment and tumor risk marker','our aim is to develop a supplementary probiotic that, used in a regular and preventive way, can reduce the amount of polyamines that our body absorbs (which are the main cause of carcinogenicity in red and processed meat), so as to maintain their concentrations within a healthy level. this probiotic will consist on polyamine auxotrophic bacteria, extracted from the intestinal human microflora, that will contain specific enzymes also found in our body. additionally, we have planned to develop a cancer risk detector by engineering a bacterial cell and developing a reactive strip that, in contact with urine, can test the risk of having a growing tumor. the principle behind this idea is that an acetylated version of polyamines are exported to the blood and later to urine. this molecules have been targeted in previous studies with a high success in both sensibility and specificity of cancer risk detection.'),(3615,'bee subtilis','bees are an important part of our daily life. recently, they became endangered due to the colony collapse disorder (ccd) which itself has multiple causes including pesticides, pathogens and pests. our goal is to modify bacillus subtilis so it can detect some factors indicating beehives\' health. this would allow beekeepers to take early measures to keep beehives healthy, and bee researchers to have an easy way to study ccd with the possibility of studying correlations between multiple factors. we plan to detect a bee pathogen, paenibacillus larvae, sugar and heavy metals levels in bees through a color detection system. once we obtain our proof of concept, this detection system could be used to detect additional factors indicating bees’ health by simply interchanging one biobrick to detect a new factor. eventually, a “reverse api gallery” system could be set up with multiple factors detection using our “bee subtilis”.'),(3616,'transforming waste glycerol from biodiesel production using bacterial biofilms','pseudomonas putida is a soil bacterium capable of surface attachment and aggregation to form biofilms. biofilms are excellent catalysts of biotechnological processes, as they are more efficient, robust and resistant than bacteria in suspension. glycerol is a byproduct from the biodiesel industry that has become a preferred substrate for industrial fermentations. the purpose of this project is to generate a platform p. putida strain to catalyze biofilm-based conversion of glycerol to interesting end-products. to this end, we intend to genetically manipulate p. putida to incorporate a synthetic genetic switch that will allow us to reprogram bacteria either to induce robust biofilm formation appropriate for biocatalysis, or biofilm dispersal to allow easy recycling of the substrate materials of the reactor. on the other hand, we will use in silico predictions to rationally modify carbon assimilation and metabolism to obtain conversion of glycerol into products of potential biotechnological use.'),(3617,'chipgineering - microfluidics, now for everyone','microfluidics already allows us to scale down a wide range of experiments, streamlining and lowering their cost. creating microfluidic chips can however be very expensive, since certain expertise and special equipment are required. our goal was to develop a method of making microfluidics more available to igem teams and researchers, while also creating tools that could be combined with these chips. by 3d-printing the molds for the chips we were able to produce cheap, high resolution devices capable of transforming e.coli more efficiently than standard protocols for transformation. we also characterised and added to the registry the recently discovered crispr associated protein cpf1 as well as the fluorescent protein unag. as cpf1 has been shown to be more effective than cas9 in certain aspects, and unag being half the size of gfp, we thought these proteins would greatly assist future igem

production of alkanes with an e.coli resistant to fatty acid. alkanes are key components of petroleum diesel, however, biodiesel molecules produced by transesterification are oxygen-rich and combustion of these esters cause malfunction and corrosion in regular engines. the development of a biodiesel free of oxygen chemically similar to the petroleum based fuel is essential to expand the lifetime of engines using the concept of drop-in. a membrane resistant to fatty acids is important for using vegetal oils as the source material and this resistance will be provided by tocopherol. the

production.'),(3621,'algaranha','the objective of this project is to produce a biomaterial for immobilizing proteins initially directed to application on burns, using immobilized enzibiotics. the term \"enzibiotics\" refers to the junction of the words \"enzyme\" and \"antibiotic\", this is enzymes exhibiting antimicrobian activity. for immobilizing these biomolecules will be used gene recombination techniques, adding the polymerization domains in the enzibiotic molecule, compatible with the spider silk proteins. both will be produced in recombinant microalgae by nuclear transformation of model microorganism chlamydomonas reinhardtii. the project will be executed by group of undergraduates and graduate students in the context of igem. it is expected to achieve spider

focuses on a kind of yeast prion called sup35. it shares some properties with normal prion, but it\'s harmless. we know that sup35 aggregates between 37 centigrade and 42 centigrade, and guanidine hydrochloride (gdnhcl) induces aggregated sup35 to separate. we decide to take advantage of three characters of sup35: assembling, thermal control and reversibility. the first circuit is based on yeast two-hybrid system. the aggregation of sup35 results in the binding of ad and bd, then downstream gene gfp expresses. in the second circuit, we split sfgfp, a variant of gfp, into two fragments: sfgfp1-10 and sfgfp11. sfgfp11 is linked to sup35. sfgfp1-10 spontaneously binds to sfgfp11 to show green fluorescence, however, aggregation of sup35 inhibits the binding, thus the fluorescence disappears. being regulated by temperature and gdnhcl, our circuits can be used as biological temperature control kill switch, as biological temperature indicator and in scientific research.'),(3623,'biohub','our project aims at designing a powerful and convenient tool for synthetic biologists to assist their research. it is web based and has a plugin system. as a web based

common chinese medicinal herbs: notoginseng. in the literature, oral uptake of notoginseng usually results in poor absorption of ginsenosides, one important group of bioactive ingredients of notoginseng, notably due to its chemical modification of glycosylations. we plan to use recombinant beta-glucosidase to modify ginsenosides to improve oral bioavailability. we will take two separate approaches: in vitro enzymatic reaction and solid fermentation to test our beta-glucosidase activity toward ginsenosides modification. we name our project igut for the purpose of emphasizing the importance of microorganisms of our gut in helping our nutrition and medicinal need, and would like to consider our recombinant beta-glucosidase containing e.coli as a model to develop new “probiotics-in-a-test-tube” for the modification of ginsenosides.'),(3625,'engineering bacteria to make natural scents from chemical wastes','aromatic aldehydes have a wide range of useful applications, from flavors and fragrances to pharmaceutical precursors and plastic additives. a large majority of these aldehydes are produced at low yield and over toxic catalysts. this gives rise to the need to produce these molecules in a renewable, environmentally friendly, and high-yield manner. our project aims to meet these goals by developing a synthetic biology route to generate a library of aromatic aldehydes from their respective inexpensive toluene-based precursors that are an environmentally toxic waste in crude oil processing. we utilize the xyl ortho pathway of pseudomonas putida, which is cloned into escherichia coli as a host platform. this pathway converts toluene derivatives with a wide range of functional groups in the meta and para positions on the ring to their corresponding aromatic aldehydes, leaving the meta and para substituents unaltered and therefore allowing for development of a library of products.'),(3626,'changing gene expression of e. coli after

not appropriate to describe lives. dna sequences are not the sole factor which decides how an organism lives. other factors are also able to control phenotype beyond generations. the purpose of our project is creating a genetic circuit functional in e. coli which allows e. coli to switch or loop back its gene expression and phenotype when each cell division takes place. this will be achieved by the use of the nrd promoter to sense to cell division, three types of sets of sigma factor/anti-sigma factor/sigma promoter control transcription orthogonally to make 3 states of gene expression, and

hype-it is to decrease current technological barriers for breeding local crops using precision genome engineering, easing the gene editing process using synbio-inspired simplified crispr/cas9 tools. hype-it brings along a software tool that associates crop traits with specific gene targets and designs optimal grnas for those targets. hype-it also incorporates a modular gene circuit that serves as an in vivo grna testing system, ensuring appropriate grna choice even when no precise sequence information of local varieties is available. we aim to develop a split-cas9 system based on viral vectors to efficiently deliver the editing machinery into the plant, and to create an affordable labcase with the necessary laboratory equipment for hype-it.'),(3628,'the counterevolutionaries','the time has come for synthetic biology to free itself from the constraints of evolution. as an engineering discipline, synthetic biology depends on its genetically-encoded parts operating in consistent and predictable ways. yet mutation and evolution break that predictability, altering the system’s behavior in disruptive or even dangerous ways, and selecting against intended transgene function. as long as evolution and mutation are allowed to proceed unchecked, the long-term stability, effectiveness, and safety of any genetic technology are at risk. our solution began by characterizing a set of mutation-prone “hotspot” nucleotide sequences, which we then applied to create new algorithmic tools for modulating any gene’s susceptibility to mutation without affecting its function. with these

metabolize phenylalanine directly in the intestinal tract with phenylalanine ammonia lyase (pal) whilst the second system will incorporate excess phenylalanine into inclusion bodies made of synthetic

include verification of the system in a bacterial probiotic strain.'),(3631,'synthetic translational control: a new method for biocontainment','synthetic biologists struggle to prevent the proliferation of genetically engineered organisms (geos) in natural systems. containment methods that operate in ecological settings must provide security comparable to physical containment. current methods fail to effectively inhibit horizontal gene transfer and environmental supplementation, and impose evolutionary pressure through the propagation of spontaneous revertants. synthetic translational control (stc) currently utilizes a redesigned leucyl-trna synthetase and cleavage enzyme in an e. coli chassis to confer metabolic dependence on a synthetically modified leucine capable of conversion to l-leucine. due to the semi-semantic property of this device, organisms cannot metabolically bypass our constraints using environmental supplementation and will display greater resistance to evolutionary escape relative to traditional synthetic auxotrophs. our work provides advancement in biosafety by isolating geos from the environment via a reliance on modified

spread of disease. our team aims to save bees by killing varroa using bacteria inside beehives. in continuous conversation with beekeepers and scientists we develop a bacterium that targets mites, leaving bees and humans unaffected. the hive-localized bacteria sense varroa and produce mite-specific toxin, eliminating the need for beekeepers to dose the product. the bacteria are dependent on a synthetic amino acid and are shut down by light to confine them to the hive. additionally, we develop an in vitro test of varroa toxicity to show the utility of our bacterium. the system is modeled in

transcription of a fluorescent reporter gene can be regulated, with a significant colour change indicating the presence of targeted rna. this is due to the conformational change that occurs within the grna strand when the targeted foreign rna is recognised and binds. as a proof of principle, the sensor will be modified to detect two bacterial diseases: lyme disease and leptospirosis, and potentially two heavy metal pollutants: mercury and lead. the modularity of the system should allow simple modification to change sensor-specificity. bacterial lysates will be detected by

release inducer chemicals based on user input. our project utilizes the violacein pathway to simulate other metabolic pathways with colored signals. by regulating gene expression in this gene set with two different inducible promoters, we are able to yield up to four different color outputs. these outputs are then measured by an open-sourced raspberry pi setup, which captures visual data via

targeting rna is advantageous because it permits a tunable and reversible editing system that can repair multiple mutations while circumventing the process of homology directed repair. we have constructed dcas9 fusions to the editing enzymes apobec1 and adar1/2 to enable crispr-targeted c-to-u and a-to-i edits to rna, respectively. we have designed and thoroughly characterized a series of

our team designed a polycistron gene expression construct, in which each gene followed by a stem-loop and an endoribonuclease cleavage site. when it is transcribed, digested by the endoribonuclease, and cleaved into independent mrnas with different stem-loops, different mrna shows different stability, determined by the designed gibbs free energy (?g) of their stem-loops, resulting in different expression level of their encoded proteins. in this way, we decouple the gene expression level of the same operon simply by designing different stem-loops. in addition, by quantitatively adjusting the

the hydrogenase activity will be inhibited in absence of oxygen and the algae can\'t stop photosynthesis forever, we design a switch altering between 2 states in which light wavelength serves as extraneous inducible factor. in specific alternation, we utilize mirna targeting the expression of key protein in photosynthesis, so we can select the hydrogen-production switch by regulating mirna. in our design, we utilize yeast-two-hybrid system and light-mediated fusion protein constructing a gene circuit where microrna can regulate the specific downstream protein expression, and finally keep algae producing h2. in this way, the blue light switch regulate chlamydomonas producing intemittent hydrogen efficienctly, acting as blue-flame bubbling.'),(3699,'counteracts: non-invasive prevention and treatment of cataracts','cataracts, the clouding of the lens, cause half of the world\'s blindness. most cataracts are age-related and arise when crystallin proteins in the lens become oxidized and aggregate over time. surgery is currently the only recognized treatment to effectively cure cataracts, but this method is expensive and invasive. therefore, we formulated a natural and non-invasive alternative. in the eye, a natural antioxidant glutathione (gsh)—produced by the enzyme glutathione reductase (gsr)—exists to combat oxidation, but gsh levels decrease with age. studies have also suggested that another enzyme-25-hydroxylase (ch25h)-can convert cholesterol in the eye into 25-hydroxycholesterol (25hc), which reverses crystallin aggregation. we expressed and purified gsr and ch25h for the prevention and treatment of cataracts, respectively. to deliver these proteins through the cornea and into the lens, we engineered biodegradable chitosan nanoparticles, thus

problem concerning agriculture, and frequently lead to great economic losses. although chemical pesticides and fungicides have been used against these pathogens, they often result in the accumulation of toxic compounds or increase the resistance of the pathogens. this is why biocontrol using microorganisms has become a viable alternative.myxobacteria are a common and diverse group of bacteria largely fed through predation, able to produce a wide range of secondary metabolites. the fungal antagonisms may be due to competition for nutrients or the production of antifungal compounds.the aim of this investigation is genetically engineer myxobacteria mainly to enhance their antifungal capabilities and increase their temperature resistance. we intend to isolate phytopathogenic organisms

chilli and potato.'),(3702,'prostal: diagnosis of prostate cancer by fluorescent protein','in costa rica, a man dies of prostate cancer every 27 hours in average, mainly because of late diagnostic. this compelled us to design a new diagnostic method using molecular techniques. for this, we use dcas9, inactive variant of streptococcus pyogenes cas9, to bind to an rna biomarker found in the urine of men with prostate cancer. this dcas9 is engineered with a protease, which is released when the cas9 binds to the biomarker rna, due to a conformational change. the released protease cleaves a

synthetic biology approach in acidithiobacillus thiooxidans and chromobacterium violaceum to enhance metal recovery from e-waste in a three-step bioleaching process. first, the enzyme teth will be overexpressed in a. thiooxidans in order to enhance leaching of copper, iron, and tin. then, c. violaceum will leach gold and silver. cyanide is responsible for this leaching activity, and the enzymes that produce it will be expressed under the control of a gold sensitive promoter. overexpression of a cyanide-degrading enzyme will reduce toxicity. implementing a voltaic cell in the final stage will allow precipitation of the previously recovered metals.'),(3704,'fractos: endolysin-powered antimicrobial system for selective lysis of acinetobacter baumannii','acinetobacter baumannii is a pathogenic, opportunistic bacterium responsible for infections in hospital environments, mainly amongst patients at icus. nowadays, it has drawn major attention given its ability to acquire resistance to commonly used antimicrobial agents. due to the widely-spread resistant mechanisms among microorganisms, antibiotics have lost their efficiency at eliminating pathogens up to the point of being non-efficient at all in the treatment of certain infections. teccem 2016 team is developing a novel, specific method to avoid acinetobacter baumannii proliferation onto nonliving surfaces through cell wall lysis, as an alternative to current antimicrobials that promote antimicrobial resistance development. the use of endolysins ensures the elimination of the pathogen of interest, as specificity for

major importance given the broad range of consequences they have on public health. human papilloma virus (hpv) has raised concern throughout mexico because of its incidence. the virus has been characterised and documented at the genetic and proteomic levels, but given its pathophysiology during infection, diagnosis at early stages is somewhat complicated and unusual, particularly because of the absence of symptoms. moreover, it is of crucial importance as some hpv strains have been shown to correlate with oncogenic outcomes. teccem_hs 2016 is developing a rapid test method by using the novelties of riboswitch technology. with careful and appropriate design, bacteria could serve as a signal provider that may give insight into the viral presence by means of fluorescence. the device

microchip for rapid detection','chemotaxis is the movement of bacteria in response to chemical stimuli. this process is mediated by chemoreceptors - membrane proteins that bind to substances with high specificity depending on their ligand binding domain (lbd). flashlab offers a set of tools for harnessing the bacterial chemotaxis system. by replacing the lbd of the e. coli tar-chemoreceptor with various lbds, or by inserting a switchable lock and key mechanism into the receptor, chemotaxis can be programmed to respond to a substance of our choice. as an implementation of our system we introduce a novel method for detecting an array of materials, such as pollutants, hormones and allergens. the engineered bacteria are confined to a microfluidics chip; the user simply inserts a sample
